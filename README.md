Here is the explanation:

To start, I have created 2 separate classes for Stateless and Stateful widgets, then I realised that to run 
each class, I have to rerun the program, then I decided to create a stateful widget and change its state 
by one button. I wrote a function for the button to change the pages. Now It's possible to go to the counter 
task from Greeting message page.

First Main page is opened and Greeting is shown(It is possible to change the message just by changing the text 
which is being passed to the parameter by returning).

You can change the page by pressing the button at the right bottom of the page. You can change the pages by that 
button. In the second page I have created a stateful widget that displays Fibonacci number series one by one. By 
clicking the button in the center, you can see the next Fibonacci number. For that i have created a function
called changeNum.

Overall, all things construct Widget Tree.
