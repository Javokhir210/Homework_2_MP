Here is the explanation:

Task 1 (Stateless):
In the task 1 I have written 2 messages to the constructor of My class while calling it in the main function. 
To check both you may comment out the one and try the next one. Now only second one will work as the first
one is commented out.

Task 2(Stateful and Widget Tree):
In this task I have created a stateful widget that displays Fibonacci number series one by one. To run 
it you should comment out the part that is calling Task 1, and call Task 2.
